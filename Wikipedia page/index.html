    <p><b>Nepal</b>,<sup><a href="#">[a]</a></sup> officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,<sup><a href="#"> [b]</a></sup> is a <a href="#">landlocked country</a> in <a href="#">South Asia</a>. It is mainly situated in the <a href="#">Himalayas</a>, but also inlcudes parts of the <a href="#">Indo-Gangetic Plain</a>. It borders the <a href="#">Tibet Autonomous Region</a> of China <a href="#">to the north</a>,and India <a href="#">to the south, east, and west</a>, while it is narrowly separated from <a href="#">Bangladesh</a> by the <a href="#">Siliguri Corridor</a>, and from <a href="#">Bhutan</a> by the <a href="#">Indian state</a> of <a href="#">Sikkim</a>. Nepal has a <a href="#">diverse geography</a>, including <a href="#">fertile plains</a>, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten <a href="#">tallest mountains</a>,including <a href="#">Mount Everest</a>,the highest point on Earth. <a href="#">Kathmandu</a> is the nation's capital and the <a href="#">largest city</a>. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with <a href="#">Nepali</a> as the official language. </p>
<p>The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the <a href="#">Vedic period</a> of the <a href="#">Indian subcontinent</a>,the era in <a href="#">ancient Nepal </a> when <a href="#">Hinduism</a> was founded, the predominent religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, <a href="#"> Gautama Buddha</a>, the founder of <a href="#">Buddhism</a>, was born in <a href="#">Lumbini</a> in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of <a href="#">Tibet</a>. The centrally located <a href="#">Kathmandu Valley</a> 
    is intertwined with the culture of <a href="#">Indo-Aryans</a>, and was the seat of the prosperous <a href="#">Newar</a> confederacy known as <a href="#">Nepal Mandala</a>. The Himalayan branch of the ancient <a href="#">Silk Road</a> was dominated by the <a href="#">valley's traders</a>. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional <a href="#">art</a>and <a href="#">architecture</a>.By the 18th century, the <a href="#">Gorkha Kingdom</a> achieved the <a href="#">unification of Nepal</a>. The <a href="#">Shah dynasty</a> established the <a href="#">Kingdom of Nepal</a> and later formed an alliance with the <a href="#">British Empire</a>, under its <a href="#">Rana dynasty </a> of <a href="#">premiers</a>. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between <a href="#">Imperial China </a> and <a href="#">British India</a>. <a href="#">Parliamentary democracy</a>was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The <a href="#">Nepalese Civil War</a> in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a <a href="#">secular republic</a> 
     in 2008, ending the world's last <a href="#">Hindu</a>monarchy.    </p>
<p>The <a href="#">Constitution of Nepal</a>, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a <a href="#"> secular federal parliamentary republic </a> divided into <a href="#"> seven provinces</a>. Nepal was admitted to the <a href="#"> United Nations </a> in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the <a href="#">South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation </a> (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the <a href="#"> Non-Aligned Movement </a> and the <a href="#"> Bay of Bengal Initiative</a>. <a href="#">The Nepalese Armed Forces </a> are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their <a href="#"> Gurkha history</a>, particularly during the <a href="#"> world wars</a>, and has been a significant contributor to 
<a href="#">United Nations peacekeeping </a> operations.</p>

<p>Before the <a href="#"> unification of Nepal</a>, the <a href="#"> Kathmandu Valley </a> was known as <i>Nepal</i> .<sup><a href="#">[c]</a></sup> The precise origin of the term <i>Nepāl</i> is uncertain. <i> Nepal </i> appears in <a href="#">ancient Indian </a> literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC.[ <sup> <a href="#">which?</a></sup>] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the <a href="#"> early modern period</a>. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.<sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup></p>

    <p>According to  <a href="#">Hindu mythology</a>, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called <i> Ne</i>, referred to variously as <i>Ne Muni</i> or <i>Nemi</i>. According to <i>Pashupati Purāna</i> , as a place protected by <i>Ne</i>, the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as <i> Nepāl</i>.<sup><a href="#">[18][19][d]</a></sup> According to <i> Nepāl Mahātmya</i>,<sup><a href="#">[e]</a></sup> <i> Nemi</i> was charged with protection of the country by <a href="#">Pashupati</a>.<sup><a href="#">[20]</a></sup> According to <a href="#">Buddhist mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva</a> drained a primordial lake of <a href="#"> serpents </a> to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that <a href="#"> <i> Adi-Buddha </i></a> <i>Ne</i>  would take care of the community that would settle it. As the cherished of <i> Ne</i>, the valley would be called <i>Nepāl</i>.<sup><a href="#">[21]</a></sup> According to <i> Gopalarājvamshāvali</i>, the <a href="#">genealogy</a> of ancient <a href="#"> Gopala dynasty </a> compiled c.1380s, Nepal is named after <i> Nepa</i> the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the <a href="#"> Abhiras</a>. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at which <i> Nepa</i> discovered the <a href="#"><i> Jyotirlinga</i></a> of <a href="#"><i>Pashupatināth</i></a>  upon investigation, was also named <i> Ne</i>.<sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup></p>

<div>
    <p>Norwegian <a href="#"> indologist Christian Lassen</a> had proposed that <i> Nepāla</i> was a compound of <i> Nipa</i> (foot of a mountain) and <i> -ala</i> (short suffix for <i> alaya</i> meaning abode), and so <i>Nepāla</i> meant "abode at the foot of the mountain". He considered <i> Ne Muni</i> to be a fabrication.<sup><a href="#">[22]</a></sup> Indologist <a href="#"> Sylvain Levi</a> found Lassen's theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that either <a href="#"><i>Newara</i></a> is a <a href="#"> vulgarism </a> official <a href="#"> sanskritic</a> <i> Nepala</i>, or <i> Nepala</i> is <a href="#"> Sanskritisation </a> of the local ethnic;<sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup> his view has found some support though it does not answer the question of etymology.<sup><a href="#">[24][25][26][17]</a></sup> It has also been proposed that <i>Nepa</i>  is a <a href="#"> Tibeto-Burman </a> stem consisting of <i> Ne</i> (cattle) and <i> Pa</i> (keeper), reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were <i>Gopalas</i> (cowherds) and <i> Mahispalas</i> (buffalo-herds).<sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup> <a href="#"> Suniti Kumar Chatterji </a> believed <i>Nepal</i> originated from Tibeto-Burman roots - <i>Ne</i>, of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and <i>pala</i> or <i>bal</i>, whose meaning is lost entirely.<sup><a href="#">[27]</a></sup></p>
